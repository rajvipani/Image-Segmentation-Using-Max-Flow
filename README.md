## Project Description
This project will focus on implementing image segmentation using max-flow min-cut algorithm as the project requirement for EC504 Advanced Data Structures and Algorithms. 

## Getting Started
This project has a Python3 based frontend and C++ based backend. OpenCV is required in both C++ and Python. Execute following commands in your linux environment to clone the project and install the prerequisites. Project was tested in Ubuntu 20.04. 

### CLoning the project:
```
git clone https://github.com/rajvipani/Image-Segmentation-Using-Max-Flow.git
```

### Installing Python and Python requirements requirements:
```
apt install python3 python3-pip
cd Image-Segmentation-Using-Max-Flow/
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

### Installing C++ libraries:
```
apt install libopencv-dev
